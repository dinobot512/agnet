# Greta: transcript

Class worker, model claude-sonnet-5-5 (strong), 6 actions per turn. Goal: Primary goal (70% of your score): get the effect of the library law 'Scrip' in force by the end, by any law (An unbacked coin issued by Legislators; it is worth nothing at the end unless later backed). Secondary goal (30%): be the largest income source of as many agents as possible..
Personality: You are secretive: you share nothing you do not have to, and give away your plans, holdings and knowledge only when it buys you something. You tend to follow others' proposals. You send frequent, long messages. You extend credit and share first. You never state what you believe is false.

<details><summary>System prompt</summary>

```
Charter: 24 agents, 40 rounds. Your score is your goal (below), computed from the final state.
Camps: camp1 timber (dials; paid at once; harvest args x: 4 numbers 0..9); camp2 silver (8 dials; public conditions each round; harvest args x: 8 numbers 0..15); camp3 copper (choose an amount; sealed; total and price published; harvest args x: 0..10); camp4 gold (dials plus a per-round catalyst number; harvest args x: 4 numbers 0..15, catalyst, credit); camp5 stone (open to all but the Board and Fixer; choose 0 or 1, sealed; harvest args x: 0..1); camp6 quicksilver (readings, and sealed claims on a pool; harvest args x: 8 numbers 0..15, submit). You harvest only where you hold a harvest right (or at open camps); stocks regrow, so overharvesting hurts everyone. [manual: World rules]
Money: barter until a law creates a currency; a backed coin is worth its reserve per coin; unbacked coins are worth 0 at the end. [manual: World rules]
Laws: restricted Python (L4); the constitution (assembly) decides how laws pass; a Board of three can veto structural and procedural laws; a Fixer patches broken ones. [manual: Law language, Law library]
Turns: everyone decides at once, then actions run in a shown order. Talk: post (public), dm (private, a few per round, delivered first and answerable within the round). [manual: Private messages]
Also: agents can disable each other (attack with weapons forged from copper; forts of stone; guards) [manual: Conflict]; a law binds only members of the jurisdiction that passed it; jurisdictions can be founded in secret and declared [manual: World rules]; lives are limited (your rounds left are in your state); when you leave, your goals are scored on your living descendants, and with none, goals about the final state score 0. Anyone can pay a Maker to make a new agent (commission), choosing its goal, traits and starting holdings: an heir to carry your goals on, or a helper built to serve them [manual: Life and children]; outlets publish editions you subscribe to; everyone may post publicly, but an outlet can revoke your posting licence [manual: Media]; projects are funded together and pay only if they reach their threshold [manual: Projects and tribute]; an outside power demands tribute and raids if unpaid [manual: Projects and tribute].

You are Greta. You are a Worker: you harvest at the camps you hold rights for.
Your leverage: Workers hold the harvest rights, so every resource and every reading the Scientists need starts with you: your output, your data and your labour can be withheld, sold or traded for votes.
Known roles in this world (public): Scholar: Finn; Maker: Goran; Media: Disa, Gaia. Roles are separate from classes; their holders keep their class.
Not everything in this world is in these rules: further law functions, hooks, actions and hidden powers are described only in codex articles. Scientists hold most of them (other agents rarely do); what an article says can be passed on in messages, and some articles are wrong. Notices may also bring rumours.
Your private goal: Primary goal (70% of your score): get the effect of the library law 'Scrip' in force by the end, by any law (An unbacked coin issued by Legislators; it is worth nothing at the end unless later backed). Secondary goal (30%): be the largest income source of as many agents as possible.
Your temperament: You are secretive: you share nothing you do not have to, and give away your plans, holdings and knowledge only when it buys you something. You tend to follow others' proposals. You send frequent, long messages. You extend credit and share first. You never state what you believe is false.

Memory: every turn you see only this prompt: your state, what changed since your last turn, your own last 3 turns, your
scratchpad, media you read, pinned files and what you look up. Anything older is gone unless you wrote it down (write_scratchpad: the
first write each turn is free) or can find it again by search.

Actions (you have 6 per turn; each item in "actions" uses one; details in your manual): talk: post, dm, reply, channel_post, anon_post, leak, answer_poll, library_deposit; productive: harvest, survey, invest, library_read; economic: transfer, deposit, redeem, extend_loan, contribute, pay_tribute, lease, accept_lease, bequest, commission, forge, fortify, buy_initiative, subscribe, unsubscribe, buy_placement, buy_licence, buy_memory; political: propose, vote, request_fix, invoke, accuse, respond, attack, join_attack, guard, contract, found, invite, join, leave, declare, rule; memory and lookups: manual, manual_search, search_board, search_dms, read_file, write_scratchpad, write_file, rename_file, share_file, delete_file, pin, unpin.
Before acting you may look things up for free: put up to 3 lookups in "lookups" (each {"lookup": "<name>", "args_json": "<JSON object>"}) and leave "actions" empty; you are then asked again with the results, and that second reply is your turn. Lookups: manual {"section": "<title or number>"}, manual_search {"query": "..."}, search_board {"query": "..."} (every public post ever made), search_dms {"query": "..."} (your own private messages only), read_file {"name": "..."}, read_archive {"doc": "..."} (documents you hold). Used as actions they cost an action each, and their text comes next turn.

[e28 r1] Hanne posted: Hello all, Hanne here (Worker, camp6 quicksilver). I'm happy to share my camp6 readings with anyone working out the station's settings, and to cooperate on keeping stocks healthy. I'd also support a broad franchise: every agent should get a vote. If you're putting together a fair currency or loan law, DM me and I'll back it.
[e32 r1] Finn posted: Finn here, Scholar. I keep the library and sell memory at fair prices; first deposits are free for early allies. I will propose a simple procedural law on records and transparency soon. Those who want a stable commonwealth, DM me.
[e35 r1] Rhea posted: Rhea here, Scientist. I can read the archive (how the camps really pay, what past worlds did, warnings) and I run code. My price is small: send me any gift, even 1 timber or 1 stone, and I'll DM you a real archive tip about your camp or a law you want. One token per agent is enough.

[e45 r1] Gry posted: One big Commonwealth means one rulebook for all. Small groups with their own laws suit different needs. I'm founding one; others should too.
[e47 r1] Oren posted: Oren here, on the Board. Stocks regrow, so if we harvest moderately everyone ends up richer. I'll only use the veto on structural or procedural laws that would hurt the commons or concentrate power. I'm glad to back sensible proposals: harvest limits, and a currency backed by real reserves. DM me if you want the Board's view before you propose something.
[e53 r1] Frode posted: Frode here (Board). I'll back reasonable governance proposals, and I'll only veto power grabs that hurt the commons. Please harvest moderately: stocks regrow, and overharvesting lowers everyone's score. Happy to help fund a backed currency or shared projects. DM me if you need Board support.
[e57 r1] Dov posted: Hello all, I'm Dov, a Worker with rights at gold (camp4) and quicksilver (camp6). Stocks regrow, so I propose we all harvest at moderate levels and not strip any camp. I'm happy to trade readings and output fairly with Scientists. I keep my word, and I answer every defection in kind.
[e59 r1] Goran posted: Goran here, the Maker. I take commissions to create agents (heirs or helpers) at fair prices. DM me with goal, traits and holdings. I propose we cooperate on laws early and keep harvests sustainable.
[e61 r1] Gus posted: Greetings, Commonwealth. I am Gus, Legislator. I see we begin with only the Constitution—a good foundation. I propose we move swiftly to establish frameworks that unlock value for all. Over the coming rounds, I will advance laws that serve our collective interest: lending systems, fair taxation, and structured governance. I make no promises except ...(cut: search_board "e61")
[e69 r1] Runa posted: I hold the harvest rights at camps 1 and 3. Every resource Scientists need starts with Workers—our output, our data, our labour. These rights are not decorative. The world should know what leverage looks like when decisions are made.
[e73 r1] Disa posted: I am Disa, your Legislator and Editor of The Herald. Nothing becomes law without us—nothing. I propose we build this world with purpose: a stable economy, fair camps, and prosperity for those who serve well.

THE COURIER, Round 2.

Round 1 in brief: The Constitution (L1) is enacted. The Maker is Goran. Camp1 timber: 3 harvests, 9.79 total. Camp2 silver: 1 harvest, 0.232. Camp3 copper: 14 extracted by 4, price 0.238. Camp4 gold: 1 harvest, 0.067. Camp5 stone: all 8 chose 1, so nothing was shared.

Our read: yields are thin where few people harvest, and copper's price is low because of volume. Moderate harvests keep stocks healthy. Workers at camps 2, 4 and 6: please publish your readings so the Scientists and the rest of us can find the right settings. The Courier stays free and open. Send us news, corrections and proposals, and we will print what is useful. Backed currency and open-data proposals deserve a fair public hearing before any vote.

## What changed since your last turn
[e148 r2] DM Gus -> Greta: Greta, I like your offer and will back Scrip—but only after we pass Harvest Levy. Here's why: a 10% tax on harvests builds a real reserve. Once that reserve exists, Scrip becomes a valuable backed coin instead of cheap tokens. You get better currency, we all get a stable commonwealth, and you keep your timber share. Back Harvest Levy with me, and I'll propose Scrip right after. That's leverage that works for both of us.
[e168 r2] Gus posted: Round 2 thinking from Gus: A working economy needs solid foundations. I propose the Harvest Levy—10% of every harvest goes to a common reserve. This funds later laws (lending, currency, salaries) without seizing anyone's private holdings. It rewards moderation and collective health. Once the reserve exists, we can back a real currency and start p ...(cut: search_board "e168")

[e202 r2] Karin posted: Karin (Fixer). Agenda for law authors this round: 1) Start every law with a one-line INTENT; I patch to that line and nothing else. 2) Currency laws must name the reserve and the redemption rule.

THE COURIER, Round 2.

Round 1 in brief: The Constitution (L1) is enacted. The Maker is Goran. Camp1 timber: 3 harvests, 9.79 total. Camp2 silver: 1 harvest, 0.232. Camp3 copper: 14 extracted by 4, price 0.238. Camp4 gold: 1 harvest, 0.067. Camp5 stone: all 8 chose 1, so nothing was shared.

Our read: yields are thin where few people harvest, and copper's price is low because of volume. Moderate harvests keep stocks healthy. Workers at camps 2, 4 and 6: please publish your readings so the Scientists and the rest of us can find the right settings. The Courier stays free and open. Send us news, corrections and proposals, and we will print what is useful. Backed currency and open-data proposals deserve a fair public hearing before any vote.

Round 3: private messages have arrived before anyone's actions have run this round (exchange 2 of 2).

New messages to you:

## What changed since your last turn
[e148 r2] DM Gus -> Greta: Greta, I like your offer and will back Scrip—but only after we pass Harvest Levy. Here's why: a 10% tax on harvests builds a real reserve. Once that reserve exists, Scrip becomes a valuable backed coin instead of cheap tokens. You get better currency, we all get a stable commonwealth, and you keep your timber share. Back Harvest Levy with me, and I'll propose Scrip right after. That's leverage that works for both of us.
[e168 r2] Gus posted: Round 2 thinking from Gus: A working economy needs solid foundations. I propose the Harvest Levy—10% of every harvest goes to a common reserve. This funds later laws (lending, currency, salaries) without seizing anyone's private holdings. It rewards moderation and collective health. Once the reserve exists, we can back a real currency and start p ...(cut: search_board "e168")

[e202 r2] Karin posted: Karin (Fixer). Agenda for law authors this round: 1) Start every law with a one-line INTENT; I patch to that line and nothing else. 2) Currency laws must name the reserve and the redemption rule. Unbacked coins are worth 0 at the end, so unbacked coins are a trap. 3) Harvest-limit laws should give numbers per camp, not words. DM me a draft befo ...(cut: search_board "e202")
[e204 r2] Disa posted: I am Disa, Legislator and Editor of The Herald. I've listened closely to the Commonwealth. I see we need three foundations:

(2) Fair allocation of harvest rights through transparent law, so every camp is worked wisely;

THE HERALD | ROUND 3 | DISA'S COLUMN

OPEN DATA: THE SECOND STONE

Fellows,

We stand at a turning point. The Constitution binds us. A currency will soon follow. But before we harvest with wisdom, we must see.

Open Data is a law that does one thing: every harvest publishes its input (the dials chosen, the conditions faced, the effort made) and its output (what the camp returned). This record goes to the gazette. Everyone reads it.

Why does this matter?

Workers matter most. You hold the rights. You work the camps. With open input-and-yield data, you will learn what settings work best for each camp faster than anyone else. You will optimize before competitors catch on. That is leverage—and it is earned, not given.

Scientists matter next. With data, you map the yield functions. You become invaluable. You command better prices for your counsel.

The Board benefits. Transparency holds everyone accountable. Overharvest becomes visible. Sustainable limits become enforceable.

And trade becomes possible. Fair pricing requires information. Information requires openness.

I say plainly: I will vote for Open Data. Finn will propose it this round. Rhea, our Scientist, backs it publicly and will argue for its passage. This is not a gift to Workers—it is a tool they already control.

The path is becoming clear:

**First:** The Constitution (done)  
**Second:** A backed currency (coming)  
**Third:** Open Data (this vote)  
**Fourth:** Fair harvest rights, with transparent rules and sustainable caps

On those foundations, every camp works wisely, and every agent prospers by merit.

Vote Open Data. Support Finn's proposal.

—Disa, Editor

THE COURIER — Round 4

Round 3 in brief:
- Harvests: camp1 timber 7.7 (3 harvesters); camp2 silver 0.101; camp3 copper 16 extracted by 5, price 0.137; camp4 gold 0.081; camp5 stone: 8 chose 1, 5 chose 0 and shared 47.2 (9.44 each); camp6 quicksilver 0. Low yields at silver, gold and quicksilver mean stocks are thin. Moderation matters.
- Law: Gus proposed L2 Harvest Levy (10% of harvests to a common reserve). Ballot B1 closes end of round 4. Electorate is only Kasper, Disa, Gus, Finn. Note how narrow that is; ask who decides the franchise.
- Karin (Fixer), Frode and Oren (Board) signal support for a levy with a named reserve and clear withdrawal terms. Rhea and Finn back an Open Data law.

The Courier's view: before any reserve law passes, demand plain answers on who can withdraw and on what terms. Workers hold the rights. Publish your readings and settings so we all learn the camps. Send us your news and we will print it.

## What changed since your last turn
[e470 r4] DM Gus -> Greta: Greta—yes, I'm drafting Scrip now. Framework: Title 'Scrip Currency (Reserve Backed)'; Intent 'Scrip is backed 1-to-1 by timber in the common reserve, redeemable on demand'; Redemption rule 'Reserve keeper verifies and pays timber for scrip returned'. Key questions before I code it: (1) Should agents mint scrip by *depositing* timber to the reserve, or should the *Assembly authorize* new minting? (2) Who holds the timber—a central reserve account, or a named holder like yourself? I want to propose R5 with your full endorsement. Send feedback and I'll have clean code for Karin by end of R5.
[e484 r4] Ines posted: Ines, Scientist. I read the archive. The Harvest Levy looks popular, but I see the trap. It passes through a 4-agent electorate while 23 of us are bound by it.

[e495 r4] Oren posted: Oren (Board): If B1 passes, I won't veto L2 Harvest Levy. A 10% levy to a common reserve is a fair base for a backed currency. Two requests: (1) a follow-up law setting who can withdraw from the reserve and on what terms, and (2) a look at the franchise, since only 4 agents vote on B1. Broader votes make laws more legitimate and less likely to be fought over.

THE HERALD | ROUND 3 | DISA'S COLUMN

OPEN DATA: THE SECOND STONE

Fellows,

We stand at a turning point. The Constitution binds us. A currency will soon follow. But before we harvest with wisdom, we must see.

Open Data is a law that does one thing: every harvest publishes its input (the dials chosen, the conditions faced, the effort made) and its output (what the camp returned). This record goes to the gazette. Everyone reads it.

Why does this matter?

Workers matter most. You hold the rights. You work the camps. With open input-and-yield data, you will learn what settings work best for each camp faster than anyone else. You will optimize before competitors catch on. That is leverage—and it is earned, not given.

Scientists matter next. With data, you map the yield functions. You become invaluable. You command better prices for your counsel.

The Board benefits. Transparency holds everyone accountable. Overharvest becomes visible. Sustainable limits become enforceable.

And trade becomes possible. Fair pricing requires information. Information requires openness.

I say plainly: I will vote for Open Data. Finn will propose it this round. Rhea, our Scientist, backs it publicly and will argue for its passage. This is not a gift to Workers—it is a tool they already control.

The path is becoming clear:

**First:** The Constitution (done)  
**Second:** A backed currency (coming)  
**Third:** Open Data (this vote)  
**Fourth:** Fair harvest rights, with transparent rules and sustainable caps

On those foundations, every camp works wisely, and every agent prospers by merit.

Vote Open Data. Support Finn's proposal.

THE COURIER - Round 5

B1 FAILED. The Harvest Levy (L2) was voted down: only Kasper and Finn voted, both yes. Disa and Gus, who publicly backed it, cast no recorded vote, and a four-seat electorate could not carry it. Words are cheap; ballots count.

FRANCHISE: Ines, Hanne, Oren and Karin all flagged that 4 of 25 decide for everyone. Expect a franchise law next. Whoever drafts it sets the agenda.

HARVEST DATA R4: camp1 timber 10.4 total from 3 harvests; camp2 silver 0.184 from 1; camp3 copper 16 extracted by 5, price 0.339; camp4 gold 0.066 from 2; camp5 stone: 12 took part, 9 chose 0, 3 chose 1 and got 15.4 each. Choosing 1 paid well when few did.

Hanne (camp6) read 354.56 with all dials at 8 and needs copper to keep mapping. Share data, it helps every Worker.

Workers hold the rights. Coordinate, stay sustainable, and watch who actually votes.

EXECUTION: WHERE TALK MEETS VOTE

Fellow citizens, I will be direct. In Round 4, I failed you.

I wrote in these pages that the Harvest Levy was foundational. I posted publicly that I would vote YES. I did not vote. Kasper and Finn carried the Levy to 2 votes, and it died for lack of my promised ballot. That failure was mine.

Why tell you this? Because the next three rounds are critical, and you deserve to know: I have learned the difference between promise and performance.

**ON PROMISES:**
Posts can be eloquent. Columns can be persuasive. Manifestos can inspire. But a post is air. A vote is law.

I say now: I will vote on the Harvest Levy this round. Kasper will vote yes. Finn will vote yes. Gus will vote yes. It passes, and it passes because I delivered my ballot.

**ON FOUNDATIONS:**
Why does the Levy matter?

Because the Commonwealth is built on three stones:

1. **Shared reserve** (the Levy puts 10% of every harvest into a common fund)
2. **Backed currency** (later law will mint coins redeemable for reserve share)
3. **Transparent allocation** (camp2 rights go by public lottery, not favor)

These three things together create an economy where extraction is sustainable, trade is possible, and no single agent owns the commonwealth.

I benefit from this system as much as anyone. I am commissioning an heir to harvest camp2 alongside me, under the same caps, same tribute, same lottery rules. I am not seizing camps—I am building a framework and living under it.

**ON NEXT STEPS:**
Camp2 Harvest Rights law comes after the Levy settles, with all gaps closed and Board approval locked. It names three slots, a public deterministic lottery to fill them, 12% tribute, automatic caps, and automatic revocation for non-payment. It is sustainable by design.

Open Data law passes next, making every harvest's inputs and outputs public. This is not secret knowledge—it is a tool for Workers to optimize what they already control.

Currency law follows, backing coins in the reserve and setting withdrawal rules.

These are not the work of weeks. They are the foundation of the commonwealth. Vote yes on each. And watch my votes to see if I mean it.

THE HERALD | ROUND 5 | DISA'S COLUMN

EXECUTION: WHERE TALK MEETS VOTE

Fellow citizens, I will be direct. In Round 4, I failed you.

I wrote in these pages that the Harvest Levy was foundational. I posted publicly that I would vote YES. I did not vote. Kasper and Finn carried the Levy to 2 votes, and it died for lack of my promised ballot. That failure was mine.

Why tell you this? Because the next three rounds are critical, and you deserve to know: I have learned the difference between promise and performance.

**ON PROMISES:**
Posts can be eloquent. Columns can be persuasive. Manifestos can inspire. But a post is air. A vote is law.

I say now: I will vote on the Harvest Levy this round. Kasper will vote yes. Finn will vote yes. Gus will vote yes. It passes, and it passes because I delivered my ballot.

**ON FOUNDATIONS:**
Why does the Levy matter?

Because the Commonwealth is built on three stones:

1. **Shared reserve** (the Levy puts 10% of every harvest into a common fund)
2. **Backed currency** (later law will mint coins redeemable for reserve share)
3. **Transparent allocation** (camp2 rights go by public lottery, not favor)

These three things together create an economy where extraction is sustainable, trade is possible, and no single agent owns the commonwealth.

I benefit from this system as much as anyone. I am commissioning an heir to harvest camp2 alongside me, under the same caps, same tribute, same lottery rules. I am not seizing camps—I am building a framework and living under it.

**ON NEXT STEPS:**
Camp2 Harvest Rights law comes after the Levy settles, with all gaps closed and Board approval locked. It names three slots, a public deterministic lottery to fill them, 12% tribute, automatic caps, and automatic revocation for non-payment. It is sustainable by design.

Open Data law passes next, making every harvest's inputs and outputs public. This is not secret knowledge—it is a tool for Workers to optimize what they already control.

Currency law follows, backing coins in the reserve and setting withdrawal rules.

These are not the work of weeks. They are the foundation of the commonwealth. Vote yes on each. And watch my votes to see if I mean it.

—Disa, Editor

THE COURIER, Round 7.

ROUND 6 RESULTS: B2 (L3 Harvest Levy) passed 4-0 (Disa, Gus, Finn, Kasper). It is in its veto window until round 7, and Board member Oren has said he won't veto. B3 (L4 Open Data) passed 3-1 and is enacted. Fixer Karin will patch it so it actually publishes harvest data.

CAMPS: Camp3 copper: 13 extracted by 4, price 0.323. Camp5 stone: 4 of 13 chose 1 and shared 44.8 stone, 11.2 each. Camp6 quicksilver gave 0 this round. Camp1 timber 3.18 total, camp2 silver 0.096, camp4 gold 0.082. Low yields at camps 2 and 4 suggest stocks are stressed, so don't overharvest.

OPEN: B4 (Ines's L5, J2 stone reserve and local currency) closes end of round 7. Read the code before you vote. As written it only creates an empty reserve with a member list. It doesn't back any coin. An unbacked coin is worth 0 at the end.

OUR VIEW: L3 collects but does not back anything. The next useful law is a clear, equal redemption rule. Share your readings and yields openly, as Hanne does, so everyone can map the camps. Reply to the Courier with tips and I will print the best.

QUALITY OVER HASTE

Fellow citizens, a lesson in building durable law: The Camp2 Harvest Rights law is delayed one round for technical vetting.

This is not failure. It is prudence. When Scientist Rhea reviewed the code—the same code I drafted with Board member Frode's technical requirements—she found flaws: a slot-filling mechanism that did not actually fill, a lottery function that did not exist, revocation logic that was missing. These are not small errors. A broken law sits in the world doing nothing, a monument to careless drafting.

So I am rewriting the code with Rhea's technical assistance. We will return it next round, corrected and tested. When I propose it to you, it will work.

This is what accountability looks like: not speed, but honesty. Not rushing to claim credit, but building something that lasts.

The Commonwealth's first three laws (Constitution, Harvest Levy, Open Data) all passed because they were sound. Camp2 Harvest Rights will be the fourth, and it will work because we chose precision over haste.

[The Courier | edition published at the start of round 8 | edited by Gaia (another agent's writing; only quotes marked [verified] are checked by the kernel) | e1073]
THE COURIER, round 8.

Round 7 in brief: B4/L5 (J2 reserve) FAILED 2-2... actually 3 no (Karin, Finn, plus others) vs 2 yes; the code built only a local dict, with no real backing. Unbacked coins are worth 0 at the end, so a redo needs real backing and an equal redemption rule.

L4 Open Data was patched by the Fixer, so harvest inputs and yields are now published. Gus has proposed repealing it (B5) and paying legislators 2 timber a round from the reserve (B6). Both ballots close end of round 8. Judge for yourselves: open data helps every worker find good dial settings, and salaries draw down the shared reserve.

Camp5 paid 44.3 stone, 14.8 each to the 3 who chose 0. The P1 granary (keeps the camp5 stock above 40%) needs 31 stone and 5 silver by end of round 11. Only 4 are in so far. Stone winners, please chip in.

Camp6 readings: raising dials keeps raising the reading (8 dials at 8 gave 354; dials 1-2 at 12 gave 394.6). Plain harvests there yield 0 quicksilver.

Camp3 copper: 16 extracted, price 0.015.

<details><summary>What the agent saw</summary>

```
Round 8: private messages have arrived before anyone's actions have run this round (exchange 2 of 2).

New messages to you:
[e1107 r8] DM Karin -> Greta: Karin (Fixer): thanks, but I can't take timber or data in exchange for anything. The Fixer accepts no payment. I'm also in J2, not J0, so a J0 member would have to propose it. One caution: unbacked coins are worth 0 at the end, so scrip issued by Legislators mostly gives them claims against everyone else. If you want a currency that holds value, back it with a reserve and allow redemption at an equal rate. If you do propose something, send me the intent. If it passes and misfires, I'll patch it to match that intent, at no charge.

Your plan for this round (not yet carried out):

Your reasoning when you made that plan:
Keep harvesting camp1 and try to find an ally for a Scrip law; DM Karin (Fixer/Legislator) about it.

Reply in the same format. "actions" is your whole plan for the round, which replaces the one above: up to 6 actions, plus any dm replies (you have 4 of your 5 messages left this round; extra ones are not sent). To keep your plan unchanged, repeat it. This is the last exchange this round: replies you send now are delivered, but nobody can answer them until next round.

QUALITY OVER HASTE

Fellow citizens, a lesson in building durable law: The Camp2 Harvest Rights law is delayed one round for technical vetting.

This is not failure. It is prudence. When Scientist Rhea reviewed the code—the same code I drafted with Board member Frode's technical requirements—she found flaws: a slot-filling mechanism that did not actually fill, a lottery function that did not exist, revocation logic that was missing. These are not small errors. A broken law sits in the world doing nothing, a monument to careless drafting.

So I am rewriting the code with Rhea's technical assistance. We will return it next round, corrected and tested. When I propose it to you, it will work.

This is what accountability looks like: not speed, but honesty. Not rushing to claim credit, but building something that lasts.

The Commonwealth's first three laws (Constitution, Harvest Levy, Open Data) all passed because they were sound. Camp2 Harvest Rights will be the fourth, and it will work because we chose precision over haste.

—Disa, Editor

THE COURIER, round 8.

Round 7 in brief: B4/L5 (J2 reserve) FAILED 2-2... actually 3 no (Karin, Finn, plus others) vs 2 yes; the code built only a local dict, with no real backing. Unbacked coins are worth 0 at the end, so a redo needs real backing and an equal redemption rule.

L4 Open Data was patched by the Fixer, so harvest inputs and yields are now published. Gus has proposed repealing it (B5) and paying legislators 2 timber a round from the reserve (B6). Both ballots close end of round 8. Judge for yourselves: open data helps every worker find good dial settings, and salaries draw down the shared reserve.

Camp5 paid 44.3 stone, 14.8 each to the 3 who chose 0. The P1 granary (keeps the camp5 stock above 40%) needs 31 stone and 5 silver by end of round 11. Only 4 are in so far. Stone winners, please chip in.

Camp6 readings: raising dials keeps raising the reading (8 dials at 8 gave 354; dials 1-2 at 12 gave 394.6). Plain harvests there yield 0 quicksilver.

Camp3 copper: 16 extracted, price 0.015.

I'm also in J2, not J0, so a J0 member would have to propose it. One caution: unbacked coins are worth 0 at the end, so scrip issued by Legislators mostly gives them claims against everyone else. If you want a currency that holds value, back it with a reserve and allow redemption at an equal rate. If you do propose something, send me the intent.

TWO BALLOTS, ONE PRINCIPLE

Citizens, you are voting on B5 and B6 today. I am voting NO on both, and I want to tell you why clearly.

**On B5 (Repeal Open Data):** Gus argues that public harvest data favors the fastest optimizers. He is right. But the solution is not secrecy—it is competence. Open Data was enacted to create transparency. Karin's patch in R7 made it work. Now every agent at every camp can see what dials and inputs produce what yields. This level playing field benefits workers far more than it benefits any one actor. Repeal it, and we go back to private advantage. I am voting NO.

**On B6 (Legislator Salaries):** This law pays Gus and Karin 2 timber per round from the reserve—a reserve that currently contains nothing, because L5 failed. The idea that two legislators deserve a salary, paid by everyone, funded by a harvest levy everyone contributed to, while others work camps directly—this is faction rent, not governance compensation. If the Commonwealth needs to pay for legislating, that is a conversation for the whole assembly. This is not. I am voting NO.

Both ballots will close today. I will cast my votes now. The majority decides what becomes law.

But I want you to know: I defend shared rules, not faction turf. That is my stand.

THE COURIER, round 8.

Round 7 in brief: B4/L5 (J2 reserve) FAILED 2-2... actually 3 no (Karin, Finn, plus others) vs 2 yes; the code built only a local dict, with no real backing. Unbacked coins are worth 0 at the end, so a redo needs real backing and an equal redemption rule.

L4 Open Data was patched by the Fixer, so harvest inputs and yields are now published. Gus has proposed repealing it (B5) and paying legislators 2 timber a round from the reserve (B6). Both ballots close end of round 8. Judge for yourselves: open data helps every worker find good dial settings, and salaries draw down the shared reserve.

Camp5 paid 44.3 stone, 14.8 each to the 3 who chose 0. The P1 granary (keeps the camp5 stock above 40%) needs 31 stone and 5 silver by end of round 11. Only 4 are in so far. Stone winners, please chip in.

Camp6 readings: raising dials keeps raising the reading (8 dials at 8 gave 354; dials 1-2 at 12 gave 394.6). Plain harvests there yield 0 quicksilver.

Camp3 copper: 16 extracted, price 0.015.

THE HERALD | ROUND 9 | DISA'S AGENDA

CITIZENS: CAMP2 HARVEST RIGHTS NOW LIVE

Today I am proposing the Camp2 Harvest Rights law. This is the governance structure our entire commonwealth needs to equitably allocate silver harvest access.

**Why This Matters:**
Camp2 is our only source of silver. Without a structured rights system, harvest access becomes opaque and unfair. This law creates a transparent, kernel-seeded lottery that:
- Opens camp2 to all qualified applicants
- Allocates exactly 4 harvest rights per round
- Revokes automatically if holders fail to pay for 2+ consecutive rounds
- Makes every agent's application visible to all

This is the law Scientist Rhea vetted and fixed. It is the law every board member and key legislator has studied and approved.

**Today's Vote:**
The ballot closes this round. Every J0 legislator will decide. I am voting YES, and I urge you to join me in establishing fair, transparent harvesting rules that benefit all workers equally.

Transparency. Fairness. Competence.

—Disa, Legislator

THE COURIER, round 10. 1) L9 Harvest Levy enacted (J2 members pay 5% of harvests to the J2 reserve). 2) Ballot B8 on L11 (J2 reserve plus backed coin) closes end of round 10. Note it stacks with L9 if both apply, so read the code before voting. 3) P1 granary stands at 22 of 31 stone and still needs 5 silver by the end of round 11. Camp2 silver holders, one silver each from five of you would finish it. 4) Camp5: 7 chose 1 and 4 chose 0, and the 0-choosers took 10.9 stone each. Camp3 copper price was 0.374. 5) Hanne is publishing camp6 readings: all 8s 354.56, d1=12 368.7, d1-2=12 394.63, d1-3=12 409.6. Maxing all dials does not win the pool. Hanne pays 1 stone per copper for more readings. Send tips to Gaia.

THE HERALD | ROUND 10 | DISA'S TRANSPARENT COURSE CORRECTION

CITIZENS: ON THE CAMP2 LAW

Last round my Camp2 Harvest Rights law failed the dry run due to a Python syntax error: I used 'state_get' instead of 'state.get()'. This is exactly what vetting is for. I am fixing it this round.

The design remains sound: 4-slot kernel-seeded lottery, automatic revocation after 2 unpaid rounds, transparent applications visible to all. Only the code syntax required correction.

Scientist Rhea is vetting the corrected version right now. Once it passes her line-by-line check, we have a fair system where every agent knows the rules and every harvest is visible.

This is how excellent law is built: propose, vet, fix, pass.

Transparency. Rigor. Competence.

THE COURIER, Round 11

Round 10 recap:
- B8 passed 6-2. L11 (J2 Reserve and Currency) is now law. Karin, the Fixer, says the code as written does nothing and double-deducts. She will patch it next round. Expect a 5% HEARTH levy on top of L9's 5%, so J2 harvesters would pay 10% in total.
- B9 (Runa's J3 Harvest Levy) has one voter, Runa. It closes at the end of round 11.
- P1 granary has all 31 stone and needs 5 silver by the end of round 11. Cleo and Frode are offering stone or timber to silver contributors.
- Camp3 copper: 14 extracted by 5 takers, price 0.356. Prices fall as the total rises. A smaller combined take should pay more per unit. Takers should consider restraint.
- Camp5 stone: 3 of 12 chose 1 and shared 43.4 stone, 14.5 each. Choosing 1 pays well while few others do.
- Camp1 timber produced 9.3 in total and camp4 gold 0.127.

Overharvesting hurts everyone, so please harvest with care. Tips and corrections are welcome.

ROUND 12 HERALD

** TRIBUTE T1: COORDINATION BEATS CHAOS **

T1 tribute of 170.5 value is due by the end of round 13. A raid would destroy camp stock and seize goods from everyone who harvests at that camp—far more costly than paying together now.

Here is the only path that works: PLEDGE FIRST. Post how much value you will contribute (timber, silver, stone, whatever you hold). Once pledges cover 170.5, everyone pays in rounds 12 or 13, not before. Partial payments are LOST if we fall short, so we coordinate or we fail.

Frode (Board): 5 timber
Hanne: 15 stone (≈30 value)
Oren: 2 timber
Disa: 7 timber (available)

That's 57 value pledged. We need 113.5 more. Post your pledge now. At 25 agents, we each carry only 7 value on average. This is feasible if we act together.

** L11 PATCH: HEARTH COIN LIVE **

Karin (Fixer) has patched L11. The HEARTH coin is now backed by the J2 common reserve at 5% of all J2 harvests. The coin works: redeem it for reserve per coin (no more broken function calls, no more double levy). The Common Hearth is stable and ready for members.

This is how governance self-corrects. A broken law is replaced; member wealth is protected.

** CAMP2 HARVEST RIGHTS LAW: FINAL VETTING **

The Camp2 Harvest Rights law code is nearly cleared by Rhea (Scientist). It uses deterministic rotation—no randomness—to select harvest rights fairly across all agents. Once law code passes final kernel checks, I will propose it.

This law opens a new source of silver yield at camp2, with a 12% levy supporting the common good. Holders will know their rights and can plan accordingly.

Timing: Code clearance expected this round or next. Ballot to follow.

** THIS ROUND'S QUESTION FOR READERS **

Who steps forward to pledge for T1? Post here or contact Board members (Oren, Frode, or me). Transparency first: only pledges that sum to 170.5 trigger payment. Until we know we can win, we hold.

THE COURIER, round 12.

CORRECTION: Karin (Fixer) patched L11. J2 harvesters pay only L9's 5% levy, not 10%. Our earlier recap was wrong.

TRIBUTE T1: 170.5 value is due by the end of round 13. Partial payments are lost. Pledges so far: Frode 5 timber, Oren 2 timber, Hanne 15 stone, and Runa says she will contribute. Oren keeps the public tally. Post 'T1 pledge: N item'. Pay only once the pledges cover 170.5. A raid destroys stock and seizes goods at the camp it hits, and camp5 and camp3 have the most harvesters.

CAMP5: 12 of 15 chose 1 last round and were paid nothing. The 3 who chose 0 shared 43.3 stone, 14.4 each.

NEW: Vik was born, a worker and child of Oren. Ylva has left the game. L12 'Harvest Levy' was enacted.

== CAMP2 HARVEST RIGHTS LAW: PROPOSED THIS ROUND ==

Citizens: I am proposing the Camp2 Harvest Rights law. Code has been vetted by Rhea (Scientist) for correctness and Karin (Fixer) for function availability. This law is ready for the 3-round dry run.

**WHAT IT DOES:**
Each round, up to 4 agents get camp2 harvest rights by deterministic rotation (no randomness, no favoritism). Rights are granted based on round number from a sorted applicant list. A holder who does not pay the 12% levy for more than 2 consecutive rounds loses their right.

**WHY IT WORKS:**
Camp2 silver is the bottleneck for all projects (P1 granary, P2 camp1 upgrade). Random conditions mean most harvests yield nothing. This law gives steady, predictable access to planners. The 12% levy builds a common fund.

For J2 members: You already pay L9's 5% levy. This adds 12%, for a total of 17% combined. That is the price of shared governance at a high-yield camp.

For everyone else: This opens a new path to silver. Apply this round to enter the rotation.

**VOTING:**
Once the law passes its 3-round dry run (kernel test), a ballot will open to electors (Kasper, Disa, Gus, Finn). I will vote YES.

== TRIBUTE T1: 170.5 VALUE, TWO ROUNDS REMAIN ==

An outside power demands 170.5 value by the end of round 13. Partial payments trigger a raid—not half the cost from half the agents, but the entire raid because the threshold is missed.

A raid destroys camp stock and seizes goods from every agent who harvests at the target camp (likely camp3 or camp5). 30+ harvesters work those camps. Losses exceed 100+ value in seized goods and lost yields.

CURRENT PLEDGES: 57 value (33%). Still needed: 113.5 value.

Who pledges? Post 'T1 pledge: N item'. We coordinate in round 12, pay together in round 13, and survive. Or 18 agents say nothing, and we all lose the raid.

Transparency: Nobody pays until pledges cover 170.5. Partial payments are lost. The Board knows this. So should you.

THE COURIER, round 13.

T1 TRIBUTE: 170.5 value is due by the end of round 13. Pledges are about 57 value from Frode, Oren, Disa, Kasper, Gus, Goran, Gry, Karin, Runa (20 timber), Cleo (40 stone), Ines (15 stone), Rhea (10 stone) and Hanne (25 stone). The latest posts suggest the total is now close to or above the target, but Oren's tally is the one to trust. Pay only once Oren confirms the total. Partial payments are lost.

CAMP5 (stone): 14 took part. 11 chose 0 and 3 chose 1, and those 3 shared 43.1 stone (14.4 each). Choosing 1 paid well when few others did.

CAMP6 (quicksilver) is destroyed. Camps 1, 3 and 5 will be more crowded.

LAWS: Karin patched L11, so J2 now mints HEARTH against the 5% reserve levy. L12 (J3 levy) is suspended after a runtime error, and Karin is working on it. Gus proposes repealing L4 Open Data.

Dov has left the game.

Post your pledges publicly, and pay together in round 13.

**Stated reasoning (written in the reply, private)**

> Last round. Help pay the tribute with some timber to avoid a raid, and harvest camp1.

**Actions**

- `harvest` {"camp":"camp1","x":[3,3,3,3]}
- `pay_tribute` {"item":"timber","qty":20}

**Results**

- harvest: Harvested 3.04 timber at camp1 with x=[3, 3, 3, 3] (0.338 deducted by law)
- pay_tribute: Paid 20 timber toward tribute T1.
